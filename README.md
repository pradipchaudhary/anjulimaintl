2. **Fake or Incomplete Resumes** – Many applicants submit incomplete or exaggerated resumes, making recruitment difficult.  
3. **Lack of Job Matching Accuracy** – Current platforms rely on keyword-based searches rather than skill-based matching.  
4. **Slow Hiring Process** – From job posting to final hiring, the process takes too long due to manual processing.  
5. **Limited Employer Insights** – Employers struggle to track candidates' performance, interviews, and hiring decisions.  
6. **Scalability Issues** – Recruitment agencies find it hard to scale operations due to manual tasks.
