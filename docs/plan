Great! 🚀 Here’s a step-by-step plan to **build an AI-powered recruitment web app** for Nepal:  

---

## **📌 Phase 1: Project Planning**
1. **Define the Core Features**  
   - AI Resume Screening  
   - AI Job Matching System  
   - AI Chatbot for Candidate Assistance  
   - Fraud Detection (Fake Job & Resume Filtering)  
   - Video & Voice Screening  
   - Predictive Hiring Analytics  

2. **Choose the Tech Stack**  
   - **Frontend:** Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS  
   - **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
   - **Database:** MongoDB (for scalability)  
   - **AI & ML:** TensorFlow.js, OpenAI API, Hugging Face  
   - **Authentication:** Firebase Auth / JWT  
   - **Hosting & Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), AWS/DigitalOcean (Backend)  

---

## **📌 Phase 2: UI/UX Design**
- Design a **clean and modern UI** using **Figma**.  
- Keep the layout **user-friendly** for job seekers and employers.  
- Ensure **mobile responsiveness** for users applying via smartphones.  

---

## **📌 Phase 3: Development**
### **1️⃣ AI Resume Screening System**  
**🔹 How it works:**  
- Job seekers upload their resumes (PDF/DOC).  
- AI scans the document, extracts key information (skills, experience, education).  
- AI scores the resume based on job requirements.  

**🔹 Tools Required:**  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** OpenAI API / TensorFlow.js  
- **Resume Parser:** PyPDF2 or Docx.js  

---

### **2️⃣ AI-Powered Job Matching**  
**🔹 How it works:**  
- AI **analyzes job descriptions** and compares them with candidates' resumes.  
- **Machine Learning models** suggest the best job matches.  

**🔹 Tools Required:**  
- **Vector Search & AI Matching Algorithm:** OpenAI Embeddings / Pinecone  
- **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow.js / Scikit-learn  

---

### **3️⃣ AI Chatbot for Candidate Assistance**  
**🔹 How it works:**  
- AI-powered chatbot answers common job-seeking queries.  
- Helps with **resume improvement, interview preparation,** and **application status tracking**.  

**🔹 Tools Required:**  
- OpenAI API (GPT)  
- Node.js with WebSockets for real-time chat  

---

### **4️⃣ Fraud Detection System (Fake Jobs & Resumes)**  
**🔹 How it works:**  
- AI detects **spam/fake job posts** using NLP-based anomaly detection.  
- AI scans **candidate resumes for fake entries** (like unverifiable companies).  

**🔹 Tools Required:**  
- NLP-based **text classification model** (BERT / OpenAI API)  
- **Database cross-verification** with verified companies  

---

### **5️⃣ Video & Voice Screening AI**  
**🔹 How it works:**  
- Candidates record **short video interviews** answering preset questions.  
- AI **analyzes facial expressions, tone, and confidence** to rate responses.  

**🔹 Tools Required:**  
- Google Vision API (Facial Recognition)  
- OpenAI Whisper (Voice Analysis)  
- TensorFlow.js  

---

### **6️⃣ Predictive Hiring Analytics (For Employers)**  
**🔹 How it works:**  
- AI suggests the **best hiring times** based on past recruitment data.  
- AI **predicts salary trends** for different job roles.  

**🔹 Tools Required:**  
- **Data Visualization:** Chart.js / D3.js  
- **AI Model for Predictions:** TensorFlow.js / Scikit-learn  

---

## **📌 Phase 4: Testing & Deployment**
1. **Run Unit Tests & AI Model Testing**  
2. **Deploy the Web App on Vercel (Frontend) & AWS/DigitalOcean (Backend)**  
3. **Launch a Beta Version for Testing**  

---

## **📌 Phase 5: Marketing & Monetization**
### **💰 How to Monetize the Platform?**  
✅ **Subscription Model** – Charge employers for premium job posts & AI screening.  
✅ **Commission on Hires** – Charge a fee when a candidate gets hired.  
✅ **Ads & Sponsorships** – Charge companies for **featured job listings**.  

---

## **Next Steps:**  
1. **Create a GitHub Repository** for development.  
2. **Start with the UI/UX Design** (I can generate Figma templates if needed).  
3. **Set Up a Simple MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** with basic AI features.
